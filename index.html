        <p>Hi there, Welcome to my biography. If you are wondering why I made this website,
            it is because I plan to use this website as part of my portfolio.
            Even though there is a high chance that this website MIGHT not be included in
            my portfolio, this website will serve as one of my starting projects when I 
            began coding in HTML and CSS.</p>  

        <p>Let us now skip to my main introduction. Once again, my name is John and
            I am an aspiring web developer. I started learning python on the first week of
            July 2020 and I started learning HTML and CSS in the last week of November 2020.
            I am sure I will face a lot of obstacles in life
            All I need to do is to believe in God that everything is possible.</p> 

        <p id="last">To start using my website, this introduction will be the Home Page.
            If you want to know more personal details about me, check out the
            "Personal Details" page. If you are amazed/curious about me,
            use the "Contact" page to contact me through email or social media.
            Thank you for using my biography website and enjoy. </p>
